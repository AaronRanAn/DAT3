### Class 1: Introduction

* Introduction to General Assembly
* Course overview and philosophy ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* What is data science? ([slides](slides/01_intro_to_data_science.pdf))
* Brief demo of [Slack](https://slack.com/)

**Homework:**

* Install [Anaconda distribution of Python 2.7](http://continuum.io/downloads), [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), and [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* Add a photo to your Slack profile
* Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (40 pages) and think about where you'd like to fit in!

**Optional:**

* Subscribe to some data-focused newsletters, to keep current: [Center for Data Innovation](http://www.datainnovation.org/), [O'Reilly Data Newsletter](http://www.oreilly.com/data/index.html), [Data Community DC](http://datacommunitydc.org/blog/newsletter/)
* Watch [Introduction to Data Science and Analysis](https://generalassemb.ly/online/videos/introduction-to-data-science-and-analysis) (50 minutes) for another look at the data science workflow
* Find an open source project hosted on GitHub that interests you


### Class 2: Git and GitHub

* Homework discussion: Any installation issues? Find any interesting GitHub projects? Any takeaways from "Analyzing the Analyzers"?
* Introduce yourself: What's your technical background? Why did you join this course? How do you define success in this course?
* Office hours
* Git and GitHub lesson ([slides](slides/02_git_github.pdf))
  * Create a repo on GitHub, clone it, make changes, and push up to GitHub
  * Fork the [DAT3-students](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT3-students) repo, clone it, add a Markdown file (`about.md`) in your folder, push up to GitHub, and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

**Homework:**

* Review the [course project information](project.md), [past projects](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples) from other GA students, and [public data sources](public_data.md)

**Optional:**

* Clone this repo (DAT3) for easy access to the course files
* Watch [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD) (36 minutes) to repeat a lot of today's presentation
* Read the first two chapters of [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) for a much deeper understanding of version control and the basic Git commands
* Learn some more [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and add it to your `about.md` file, then push those edits to GitHub and send another pull request
* Read this friendly [command line tutorial](http://seankross.com/notes/cli/cli.html) if you are brand new to the command line
* For more project inspiration, browse the [student projects](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html) from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) at Stanford

**Resources:**

* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is a browser-based Markdown editor, useful for checking your Markdown code
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is an excellent reference guide for Git commands
* [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter reference guide with commands grouped by workflow


## Class 3: Base Python

* Any questions about Git/GitHub?
* Discuss the [course project](project.md).  What's one thing you learned from reviewing student projects?
* Why are we programming? Why are we using Python?
* Base Python lesson ([code](code/03_base_python_class.py))
